# Method

## How to Quickly provide multilingual summaries of YouTube videos. This is achieved through the following methods:

1. Utilize local or database to store video summaries. The browser extension will prioritize displaying matching video summaries. If no corresponding summary is found in the database, it will call an LLM (Language Learning Model) to generate a summary and store.
2. The browser extension will also collect 10 recommended videos to database, summarize them in parallel, and store the summaries in the local or database.
